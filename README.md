## üîß Network Architecture

All services use a shared Docker network (`shared-net`) for inter-service communication. SWAG acts as the central reverse proxy, providing:
- Automatic SSL certificate management via Let's Encrypt
- Subdomain routing (e.g., `plex.yourdomain.com`, `ha.yourdomain.com`)
- Rate limiting and security headers
- Cloudflare DNS integration

## üìã Environment Variables

Most services require environment variables stored in `.env` files. Common variables include:
- `DOMAIN_NAME` - Your domain name
- `SWAG_ADDRESS` - SWAG container address
- Database credentials
- API keys and tokens
- Email configuration for notifications

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Requirements

### Minimum Specs
- 4GB RAM (8GB+ recommended)
- 2 CPU cores (4+ recommended)
- 100GB storage (SSD recommended)
- Ubuntu 22.04+ or similar Docker-compatible OS

### Recommended Hardware
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU for Plex transcoding, Frigate object detection, and Ollama
- **Coral TPU**: For enhanced Frigate object detection
- **USB Devices**: Zigbee coordinator, Z-Wave stick for Home Assistant

## üìñ Getting Started with Individual Services

Each service directory contains:
- `docker-compose.yml` - Main configuration
- `.env.example` - Environment variable template (if applicable)
- `README.md` - Service-specific documentation (where available)

### Example: Starting Plex
```bash
cd plex/
# Copy and configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
nano .env

# Start the service
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

## üîÑ Maintenance

### Updates
Most services use Watchtower for automatic updates, but you can manually update:
```bash
cd <service-directory>
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
```

### Backups
Important data directories to backup:
- Configuration directories for each service
- Database volumes
- Media libraries (if stored locally)

### Monitoring
- Grafana dashboards provide system metrics
- Healthchecks monitors service availability
- SWAG logs provide access and security information

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Notes

- Change default passwords in all `.env` files
- Regularly update containers for security patches
- Use strong passwords and enable 2FA where available
- Consider firewall rules for exposed ports
- Review SWAG security configurations
